[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) enables scalable and reproducible
scientific workflows using software containers.

## Set up for testing purposes only

1. Java 11 or later is required (up to 19 is supported);
   `script/install_openjdk.sh` will install OpenJDK 19 into `bin`. Do not
   install version 20 or you will get the following error:

    ERROR: Cannot find Java or it's a wrong version -- please make sure that Java 8 or later (up to 19) is installed

```console
script/install_openjdk.sh
